I'm a recent graduate from the University of California, San Diego, where I studied the brain from an interdisciplinary perspective using tools from the fields of computer science, neuroscience, and psychology. I have experience working with machine learning frameworks (scikit-learn, TensorFlow), object-oriented programs (Java, Python, C++), and front-end tools (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
